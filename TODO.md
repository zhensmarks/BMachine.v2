# Pending Tasks & Roadmap

The following tasks are prioritized for the next development phase:

## 1. Task Monitor (Background Operations)
- [ ] Implement a non-intrusive operations window (similar to TeraCopy).
- [ ] Run file copy/move operations in the background to avoid blocking the UI.
- [ ] Display progress, speed, and allow pause/resume.

## 2. Bug Fixes
- [ ] **Path Bar Checklist**: Fix visual state inconsistency where the checklist item in the menu does not reflect the actual visibility of the Path Bar.

## 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] Add standard Windows Explorer shortcuts support in Settings.
    - `Ctrl + C` / `Ctrl + V` (Copy/Paste)
    - `Delete` (Move to Trash)
    - `F2` (Rename)
    - `Ctrl + Shift + N` (New Folder)

## 4. Testing
- [ ] Verify Batch features functionality (Script execution, multi-file processing).
